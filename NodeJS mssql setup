Once you have a group of databases and some good data prepared with linked servers you're ready to start
integrating your node environment so you can serve links into your sql servers, and out to the public if
requested.

So at this point, again assuming you've installed node and inherently npm, we'll begin with the following.
If you arrived at this page but are uncertain where to start, go back to the document on working within SQL.

There's a few packages you're going to need to get with npm so begin by creating the folder you want 
your work to be in.  Change to that directory and begin by installing express, and node-mssql.

Initialize an empty node project by typing <code>NPM INIT </code>
